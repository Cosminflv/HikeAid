  /// has entered or exited the follow position mode.
  ///

  ///   - [onStatusUpdated]: A callback function that is called when the position-following status changes.

  /// completion callback can be set.

  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - [viewAngle]: The initial view angle (in degrees) of the camera. Defaults to `0`.
  ///   - [zoom]: The zoom level to apply. Defaults to `70` (medium zoom level).
  ///   - [onComplete]: An optional callback to be called when the camera movement is complete.

  ///   - [mode]: The [DFollowPositionRotationMode] specifying the camera's rotation mode.
